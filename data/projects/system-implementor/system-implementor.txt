I've been looking over the code for the system implementor and it looks pretty good.
Basically it processes a text with KNext, then postprocesses the output.
The output consists of "general world knowledge" extracted from the text.
This is enough to specify classes, attributes, and functions.
To get the exact behavior will be more difficult.
We would have to align the text against these objects and extract the relationships between the items in the text.
Then populate perhaps functions that would implement the desired behavior.
